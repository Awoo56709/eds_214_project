  ##  The code is appropriately commented
    - I would argue that this is professional quality in that as a data scientist, we are supposed to present our findings in a easily digestible format. One part of this is to have code that is easily explainable. If some one is cloning your repo that does not have much experience in programming, additional information is better than less.
    
  ## The student has contributed to a peerâ€™s repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request
    - While my contribution to my peer's repo was simple, I note that there being no apparent flowchart can make or break the understanding of someones assumptions about the work being presented. As someone that is not as experienced in programming/coding, having a flowchart helps us understand why someone decided to do certain steps a certain way and how it might differ from your own workflow and may actually cause different results is possible when reproducing.
    
# Collaboration

1) I believe it was more beneficial to me because as someone that is not experienced in coding, I am able to see someones coding style and approach. Looking at my code, I made it way more complicated than it needed to be.  Going through the checklist made me think more critically about the expectation and approachable ways of coding. For instance, my initial draft was not documented as much if someone looking through my code, would need to know how to code to understand.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[NY] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

- Contents of the scripts/ folder does the data processing steps separately, but is repeated in paper.qmd

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[NY] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

- See **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

[M] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[NY] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

- Flowchart is a bulleted list instead of a visual

[NY] **The code is appropriately commented**

- Generally very good! The Roxygen documentation is excellent. The moving_average() function has a lot of commented-out code that should be removed.

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[E] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

- Great work! Even simple contributions can be very helpful if they address an important need and are done cleanly and professionally.

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
