  ##  The code is appropriately commented
    - I would argue that this is professional quality in that as a data scientist, we are supposed to present our findings in a easily digestible format. One part of this is to have code that is easily explainable. If some one is cloning your repo that does not have much experience in programming, additional information is better than less.
    
  ## The student has contributed to a peerâ€™s repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request
    - While my contribution to my peer's repo was simple, I note that there being no apparent flowchart can make or break the understanding of someones assumptions about the work being presented. As someone that is not as experienced in programming/coding, having a flowchart helps us understand why someone decided to do certain steps a certain way and how it might differ from your own workflow and may actually cause different results is possible when reproducing.
    
# Collaboration

1) I believe it was more beneficial to me because as someone that is not experienced in coding, I am able to see someones coding style and approach. Looking at my code, I made it way more complicated than it needed to be.  Going through the checklist made me think more critically about the expectation and approachable ways of coding. For instance, my initial draft was not documented as much if someone looking through my code, would need to know how to code to understand.
